# Ardunio-USF-Project
A group project I did my freshman year of college for ENG 3000L. The purpose of this assignment was to create a marketable robot for children using an Arduino kit provided by the course.
This project was never completed as the hardware was unable to fit in the enclosure to allow the robot to properly maneuver, causing issues with wires becoming disconnected from the inside.
I have decided to upload the code I used during the creation and prototyping of the project, which includes usage with the Arduino Uno, DC motors, h-bridge, servo motors, an rf remote, an ultrasonic sensor, including the wire connection documentation alongside it featured in the comments.

The 'Executive Summary 4 Code' is the main file used for the robot and the rest were simply for testing different features for implementation or practice.
